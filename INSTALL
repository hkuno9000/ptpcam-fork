In the ideal case, it should suffice to run

	autoreconf -is
	./configure
	make

However, on some systems this fails because no config.h is generated.
This appears to be because it would be empty, and a nonexistent file is "good enough" for part of the toolchain.
The workaround which seems to work is

	autoreconf -is
	./configure
	touch config.h
	make
